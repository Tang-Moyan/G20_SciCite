"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al.",method,0.7305,Long

"For example, Kawato et al. (1990) suggested that movement trajectories can be projected using critical via-points through which the trajectory has to pass at a certain time, rather than in terms of the moment-by-moment dynamics of the implemented movement trajectory. Optimal trajectories can then be learnt by applying local optimising principles for getting from one via-point to the next. In this way, impoverished predictions can be used to monitor rich implementations. In the same way, language users might predict particularly crucial aspects of an utterance, but the aspects that they predict will depend on the circumstances. More generally, Meyer & Hagoort question the value of predicting one’s own utterance. They argue that prediction is useful when it is likely to differ from the actual event. This is the case when predicting another person’s behaviour or when the result of one’s action is uncertain (e.g., moving in a strong wind). But they argue that people are confident about their own speech. Meyer & Hagoort admit that they will tend to be less confident in dialogue, and we agree. But more important, we argue that the behaviour of the production implementer is not fully determined by the production command, because the complex processes involved in production are subject to internal (“neural”) noise or priming (i.e., influences that may not be a result of the production command). Assuming that these sources of noise do not necessarily affect forward modelling as well, predicted speech may differ from actual speech. In addition, prediction is useful even if the behaviour is fully predictable, because it allows the actor to plan future behaviour on the basis of the prediction. In fact, we made such a proposal in relation to the order of heavy and light phrases (see sect. 3.1, target article).

"multiple equilibria, see Albanesi et al. (2003), King and Wolman (2004) and Blake and Kirsanova (2012), and a simple New Keynesian model is not appropriate to investigate many consequences of policy delegation. As there is no particular reason to assume one equilibrium will prevail any more than another, even if the delegation schemes behave locally as intuition might suggest globally could be a different matter. The central questions addressed in this paper follow on from this. How do delegation schemes affect the likelihood of obtaining multiple equilibria in more realistic models? If multiplicity survives, how should we quantify the welfare implications of choosing one of these delegation schemes? Can any of these schemes affect the likelihood that economic agents successfully coordinate on the best equilibrium? To address these questions we study a version of the familiar sticky price model modified to incorporate capital accumulation (Sveen and Weinke, 2005; Woodford, 2005). This model contains all the features as at the heart of many DSGE models used in policy analysis which makes it a ‘representative agent’ for our policy analysis. Moreover, we choose a set up which encompasses the ‘worst case’ scenario: there are expectation traps and economic agents may be more likely to coordinate on the worst equilibrium (Dennis and Kirsanova, 2012). We confirm the previous results that all these delegation schemes can improve social welfare, but we show that they only unequivocally improve welfare if the economy remains in the best equilibrium. At the same time, we demonstrate that none of the considered delegation schemes eliminates expectation traps, moreover, new equilibria arise under delegation. Whether there is a gain associated with a transition to a delegation scheme will depend on which equilibrium under the original unmodified objective one starts from and to which equilibrium one transitions. More encouragingly, all delegation schemes reduce the range of parameters which ensure the unique worst equilibrium, thus increasing the likelihood of coordinating on the Pareto-preferred equilibrium. We also argue that a delegation scheme can change the way how agents coordinate on an equilibrium. In particular, we show that price level targeting increases the likelihood that the best equilibrium realizes. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we outline the model and discuss the calibration. Section 3 recapitulates the analysis in Blake and Kirsanova (2012) for our sticky-price model with capital, showing how multiplicity arises when monetary policy is conducted under discretion and with an unmodified monetary policy objective.",background,1.0,Long

"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart.",result,0.754,Long

Xing and Detert (2010) examined the case of the iPhone and found that China just contributed only 3.6% of $2.0 billion export to the US, the rest was simply a transfer from Germany, Japan, Korea, the US, and other countries. These studies rely on “tear down” analyses that assign the value of individual components to source companies and their countries. These firm- and product-based case studies can provide intuitive images of GVCs in terms of the activities of multinational enterprises. However, when we examine the Chinese economy’s role in global production networks as a whole, its share of total value added through the export of final products to the United States was actually about 75% in 2005 (Meng et al., 2011). This indicates that the “tear down” case studies focus on only the supply chain of a specific firm and particular products, and are clearly not representative of the broader role of China’s domestic production networks and inter-industrial linkages in the whole value creation process. Other work on this topic shows that domestic value added can vary substantially between different economic sectors (see Koopman et al. (forthcoming 2013), Erumban et al.

The present study found that work organisation impacted on the adoption of work practices involving greater risk. In the assembler-welder working situation, part supply problems linked to organisational deficiencies in the logistics sector obliged operators to adopt a work practice involving risk. Indeed, when available, parts could be prepared at the start of chassis assembly. Otherwise, operators had to climb more often onto, or down from, a template to collect parts (climbing down from templates being particularly unsafe).

"The real-world spaces that surround information users have been diversely called everything from personal information environments (Kwasnik, 1991; Malone, 1983) to personal information management (PIM) systems (Barreau, 1995) and personal spaces of information (Jones, 2007). Drawing upon interviews with academics, Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate,” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent,” such as a nearby university library; and “outside,” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991).

"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al. (1992) are agreed that if outgroups are to be added, they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa (a conclusion that is con¢rmed in this paper). More recently, consideration of the estimation of large phylogenies has led to the contradictory advice that the number of sequences included in a study be reduced (Kim 1996) and increased (particularly to break long branches in trees (Hillis 1996)) in order to improve inferences (see also Hillis 1998).

"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al. (1992) are agreed that if outgroups are to be added, they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa (a conclusion that is con¢rmed in this paper).",background,0.7504000000000001,Long

Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991).",background,1.0,Long

For example, the families can be formed without a particular House parent and the names are not linked to designers or House founders (i.e. Mafia, Foxx, Golden, Kardashian) (Alonzo Gibson, personal communication 8/14/2015). The family scene emerged as an attempt to reject the perceived rigidity of the Ball scene for up and coming participants. In particular, families formed as an opportunity to provide a safe space where youth could practice ‘vogueing’ and other ball competition skills without experiencing the shade or ‘chopping’ (being cut from the category by judges) that occurs during the competitions. Family scene members may move into the Houses as they get more skilled but they may also remain independent of the Houses and still participate in the balls. This new scene provides new opportunities for youth to become involved in the Ball scene without necessarily belonging to a particular House. The HBC thrives, in part, by serving as an in-group for youth who are so frequently excluded from acceptance within more dominant groups (Rowan et al., 2013). Additionally, the HBC provides both the much-needed acceptance and support that they lack in other contexts, and a safe outlet for expression, camaraderie, and fun. Therefore, although the HBC is a socially constructed space, it is one of few spaces in which Black GBT youth are able to fully embody their multiple identities in a safe space. For example, Kubicek, McNeeley, Holloway, Weiss, and Kipke (2013) observed the acceptance of gender and sexual fluidity of many of the House members and Ball participants.",background,1.0,Long
